            <h3>About the Statue of Liberty</h3>
            <p>The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor.</p>
            <p>Dedicated on October 28, 1886, it was a gift from France to the United States, symbolizing freedom and democracy. Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel, the statue stands at 151 feet tall, or 305 feet including its pedestal. It has become an enduring symbol of the United States and a welcoming sight for immigrants arriving from abroad.</p>
            <p>The statue is made of copper and has developed a green patina over the years. Visitors can explore the grounds, visit the museum, and take a ferry ride for stunning views of the statue and the Manhattan skyline.</p>
